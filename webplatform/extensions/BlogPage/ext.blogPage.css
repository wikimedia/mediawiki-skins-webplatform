/* Absolute positioning sucks.
 * This should be properly fixed in BlogPage somehow; I'm sure that this solution is way more

 * Anyway, we need this to position the "About the Author" box sensibly on Blog: pages.
 * Otherwise/by default it'd get positioned so that it'd potentially obscure the site
 * notice area.
